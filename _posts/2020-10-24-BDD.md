We want to have a representation of circuits that is:
* Compact
* Efficient to manipulate
* Easy to compare

## Boolean Functions
A Boolean function is a function $f:$ {0,1}$^k \rightarrow$ {0,1}

Note that Boolean functions are different from Boolean expressions. A Boolean function can be expressed as different Boolean expressions that are logically equivalent.
Take the circuit for XOR as an example:
$F(A,B) = (A + B)\cdot(\overline{A\cdot B}) = A\cdot\overline{B} + \overline{A}\cdot B$


| A | B | F|
|---|---|---|
| 0| 0| 0|
| 0| 1| 1|
| 1| 0| 1|
| 1| 1| 0|

## Binary Decision Trees
![Binary Decision Tree]({{ "/assets/BDT.png" | absolute_url }})
$f(x1,x2,x3) = \bar{x_1}\bar{x_2}\bar{x_3}+x_1x_2+x_2x_3$

The size is exponential in the size of number of variables, so it is not a compact representation.

* Each nonterminal vertex v is labeled by a variable var(v) and has arcs directed toward two children: 
    * lo(v) (shown as a dashedline) corresponding to the case where the variable is assigned 0, and 
    * hi(v) (shown as a solid line) corresponding to the case where the variable is assigned 1.  
* Each terminal vertex is labeled 0 or 1.

## Shannon Decomposition
$$f = x \cdot f_x + \bar{x}\cdot f_{\bar{x}}$$

$f_x$ and $f_y$ are the resulting functions when some argument $x$ is assigned a constant value of either 0 or 1. They are called *cofactors* of $f$.

We can use this formula to turn a boolean function into a BDD.


## ROBDD
Reduced, Ordered, Binary Decision Diagram (ROBDD), usually referred to as just BDD, discussed by Bryant (1992) in the paper [*Symbolic Boolean manipulation with ordered binary-decision diagrams*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/136035.136043), is an efficient data structure for representing and manipulating Boolean functions symbolically. It gives a **canonical** representation of a boolean function as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Canonicity means if the order of the variables are fixed, then each boolean function has a *unique* representation as an ROBDD. This means we can compare boolean functions by constructing their ROBDDs and checking if they are equal by a simple pointer comparison. The technique is useful for equivalence checking two circuits (e.g. original circuit and an optimized one).

## Reduction of Decision Tree to BDD
* Remove Duplicate Terminals

    Eliminate all but one terminal vertex with a given label and redirect all arcs into the eliminated vertices to the remaining one.
* Remove Duplicate Nonterminals

    If nonterminal vertices u and v have var(u) = var(v), lo(u) = lo(v), and hi(u) = hi(v), then eliminate one of the two vertices and redirect all incoming arcs to the other vertex.
* Remove Redundant Tests

    If nonterminal vertex v has lo(v) = hi(v), then eliminate v and redirectall incoming arcs to lo(v)
